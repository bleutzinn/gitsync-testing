## SimpleMDE demo !!!

This is **markdown**. You can edit me with SimpleMDE.

Please **do not** edit this page with ContentTools as it will remove all this content and replace it with whatever you enter. And it will save your content in HTML. That's not bad as long as you remain editing with ContentTools.

Note: the editable_self configuration isn't working right. Well, it is now but I had to resort to testing for a string value, a boolean value and a numeric value.
