## Demo MD-1

This is a demo of the "editable_self" mode.

After logging in (use 'john' and 'Demo0123') you can start editing this page by clicking on the **Edit me** button at the right.

Change text, save by clicking the Save button and reload the page.

So I suppose cache is active / enabled?

Also test editing of non root pages like [Demo Child One](demo-md-1/demo-child-one).
