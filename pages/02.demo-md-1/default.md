## Demo MD-1 &gt;!&lt;   :)

This is a demo of the "<i>editable_self</i>" mode. GitSync is done in the background so saving feels snappy again. Yahoo !

After logging in (use 'john' and 'Demo0123') you can start editing this page by clicking on the <b>Edit me !</b> button at the right.

Change text, save by clicking the Save button and reload the page.
Now using config...
