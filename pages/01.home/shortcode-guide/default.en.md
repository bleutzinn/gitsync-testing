## Shortcode Guide

The name parameter is the id or the name of the editable region on the page and also is the name of the page containing the editable content of that region. In the example above, the name 'part-1' refers to the child page with the slug 'part-1'.

Editable regions need not be stored in child pages but in any valid filepath location. For example this shortcode refers to a page in the root of the site:

[editable name="/about-us" /]

`[editable name="example-1" /]`

`[editable name="example-2" /]`

`[editable name="example-3" /]`
