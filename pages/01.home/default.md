## Editable plugin with SimpleMDE Markdown Editor.

This is a demo of the [Editable plugin](https://github.com/bleutzinn/grav-plugin-editable/blob/master/README.md) for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) when used with [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) as the editor.

BTW Sorry for the multitude of pages. It's a result of syncing with the already present content there. Default content is loaded every 10 minutes, so all should be fine. And uh, that will also clear things up in the GitHub repository.

After logging in (use 'john' and 'Demo0123') you can start editing this page by clicking on the **Edit me** button at the right.

> Note: saving changed content is real. This means that multiple persons can edit the same content at the same time. This can get confusing and can cause the original demo content to be lost. Please do not delete or mangle these texts too much.
> To be safe, the original demo content is reset every 10 minutes.

Have fun !
