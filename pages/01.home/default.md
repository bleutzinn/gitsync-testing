## Editable plugin with SimpleMDE Markdown Editor

This is a demo of the [Editable plugin](https://github.com/bleutzinn/grav-plugin-editable/blob/master/README.md) for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) when used with [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) as the editor.

The first thing to do is to **log in** (use '**<font face="Courier New">john</font>**' and '**<font face="Courier New">Demo0123</font>**'). Once logged in you can play around on the two demo pages.

> Note: saving changed content is real. This means that multiple persons can edit the same content at the same time. This can get confusing and can cause the original demo content to be lost. Please do not delete or mangle these texts too much.
> To be safe, the original demo content is reset every 10 minutes.

Have fun !
