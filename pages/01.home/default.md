## Editable plugin with SimpleMDE Markdown Editor

This is a demo of the [Editable plugin](https://github.com/bleutzinn/grav-plugin-editable/blob/master/README.md) for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) when used with [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) as the editor.

After logging in (use 'john' and 'Demo0123') you can start editing this page by clicking on the **Edit me** button at the right.

&gt; Note: saving changed content is real. This means that multiple persons can edit the same content at the same time. This can get confusing and can cause the original demo* content to be lost.* Please do not delete or mangle these texts too much.
# Have fun !
