## Demo page for edits with ContentTools

It's important to separate testing with Froala and ContentTools because the latter does not respect the Editable separator in page content.

BTW if below this you see shortcodes then probably ContentTools is not active. Check the `user/config/plugins/editable.yaml` file.
