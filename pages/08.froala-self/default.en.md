<p style=""><strong>And</strong> this is draft.</p><p style="">I must say, I'm very happy to see that autosave is working. And also that changes are reflected by the Approve button color change.</p><p style="">The fact that there is just a single Approve button for multiple regions bothers me. Another thing is that the looks and position of the Approve button is very similar to the buttons of ContentTools So, even though users will not switch between editors it still confuses even myself. I feel the need to click it often so it turns green again. Effectively doing a Publish to the live website and to a large extent bypassing the benefits of draft publishing mode.</p><p style="">Froala is a subtle little thing. One solution for the different draft state per region/editor is to change the color of the Froala button bar. Normally it's black (greyish would be better). When the content is live it's color is? Green?</p><p style="">Also when I implement the Hold-Shift-To-See-What-Is-Editable I could use the color indication as well. Green for live/fimal content and orange for regions with draft content.</p><p style=""><br></p><p style=""><br></p><p style=""><br></p>
